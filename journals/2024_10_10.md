- I've been thinking about #observibility lately.
	- Read through most of https://www.amazon.com/Observability-Engineering-Achieving-Production-Excellence/dp/1492076449 twice.
		- This is an artifact of me getting the galley copy #pirated. ü§∑
			- Sometimes it's nice to have a shared folder. [[file permissions]] are important.
	- Observability enables the debug cycle when not everything is running on the same machine.
		- It tells us where to look
			- Allows us to detect anomalous state, and localize by clearly identifying what component went wrong.
			- Gives us diagnostic information needed to reproduce the result, local to the event, and replay if needed
- Weirdly exciting for me today: I can reasonably make a (‚Å†[Public permalink](https://pactadatadev.blob.core.windows.net/ghactions-workflow-transition-monitor-results-reports/rmi_pacta_2023q4_pa2024ch-20241010T083016Z/DE/bank/1/working_dir/50_Outputs/rmi_pacta_2023q4_pa2024ch/report/index.html#real-estate)) to a build which is technically failing, but it's just formatting now.
	- LIke that's kind of crazy. I've got a stable URL that I can use in diagnosing issues, which I can share with users outside my organization _ without restriction_
		- This is exceptionally useful when others can work in the open, and directly comment on the GitHub issue, and have a working thread
			- very comparable to working in a Word document with comments enabled.
		- Build system is with comments and formatting turned off.
	- Working in open source allows us to lean on other organizations for contributions, and develop a common working language.
