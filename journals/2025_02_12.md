- I’ve set up logseq on my phone, to complement my computers and also on my wife’s iPad.
	- This entry from #iPhone
	- This is an entry from #iPad
	- Support for setting up #logseq sync on #ios with [[[[working copy]] came from https://github.com/CharlesChiuGit/Logseq-Git-Sync-101/wiki/For-iOS-iPadOS-users-(Working-Copy)
- This is my First time using an #iPad extensively in years (last used regularly in ~2016).
	- still very much getting used to the keyboard
	- Part might the language settings, but we’re taking it as it comes.
	- would like to have a good mechanism for taking notes with the [[Apple Pencil]], possibly with [[GoodNotes]] or some similar app.
