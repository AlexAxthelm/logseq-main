- [[VPN]] Settings
	- Appears [[MacOS]] dropped support for split tunnel in OS 12
	- Tried manually adding routes (`sudo route add`), but commands returned errors
	- VPN works normally, but blocks network traffic
		- Brandon suggests that this is the VPN not splitting traffic, and [[Azure]] disables external traffic by default to avoid ingress/egress costs
