- Watched [[Video/The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture]] by [[Person/Martin Fowler]]
- Working on designing an [Event-driven](Event-Driven Architecture) [[Idle Game]] (currently [[{idle.s7}]])
	- Core mechanic right now is to have resources that increment automatically with "miners" (rather than "clickers" in a "cookie-clicker" type game)
	- users can purchase "miners" to get more resources, purchased using those same (or different) resources
	- Issue I'm running into right now is on validation of "purchases"
		- Ideal flow: User Orders -> check wallet -> charge wallet and add miner (or notify user if insufficient funds)
		- Having trouble with modeling what happens if multiple "purchases" are made simultaneously (over-withdrawing from wallet)
		- Suggestion from [[Book/Designing Data Intensive Applications]]:

		  “Alternatively, the user request to reserve a seat could be split into two events: first a tentative
		  reservation, and then a separate confirmation event once the reservation has been validated (as
		  discussed in “Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast”). This split allows the validation to take place in an asynchronous process.”

			- So in this model, I would have something like: User Orders -> Tentative Miner Add -> Charge Wallet -> (if good) Confirm Miner Add / (else) Notify User
