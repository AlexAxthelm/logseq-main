- "The value of new errors" Intermediate / Advanced R (Engineering) course
	- Not affiliated with Advanced R (the book), but we will be referring to that text (and other sources) frequently
	- Practical course: each student brings 1 project to work on.
		- Public code only, although course will touch on how to integrate private code sources in deliverables.
			- Private projects looking to migrate to public safely will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
		- No accreditations, but prior to being an R developer, I have another 7 years teaching experience in classrooms ranging from 400 person lectures to 1:1 tutoring/mentoring. I decided that academia wasn't for me, but I miss the art of teaching.
			- if your organization has a budget for "professional mentoring," or similar learning & development funds, I can help you put together a letter for your managers for focused time on your projects.
			- If not, that's okay. A large part of the value of open-source projects is to serve as a reference for others to use.

					- Technically
					- Special Aside for managers
						- You may have contracts, (in my case #CUSIP ) that are not immediately obvious why you have them. Some of these may be cancelled, some may not.
						- In our case, the contract allows us to process information about companies in north america. Not _technically_ necessary, but functionally. #technical-vs-functional

		- The Value of Open in the era of AI
			- Having traceable sources implies a chain of trust, but generally the chain is trustworthy
				- Most things work. Most of the time.
			- Not having to sign an NDA or contractor agreement or be employed by a particular company makes it a lot easier to collaborate in finding solutions.
		- This applies to data as well as code.
		- Basically the fundamental concept of "citation" has been lost.
