- PACTA Weekly Meeting
	- [[Checkin Question]] "What do you eat for breakfast?"
	- What is [[Agile]]
		- Open Question: What is Agile
			- Flexibility on team, responding to needs
			- Efficiency, Allocation of responsibilities
			- Counter to [[waterfall model]] , micro view of near term, and constant updating
			- [[Me]] Do a thing, see if it works, fix it, and repeat until its what you want
			- Justification for being unstructured
		- Alternative to [[waterfall model]], where everything is sequential, and not revisited.
		- Agile originates from software development, then migrated to other industries
			- Increasingly common to see sales & management as agile teams
		- Historically, project lifecycles have gotten shorter
			- Cars used to have a manufacturing lifespan of 7-9 years (basically the same car), now down to 1-3
			- New phones every year
		- Change from complicated to Complex
			- Complicated: many steps, all clear, can be planned/mapped
			- Complex: Many steps, not all steps are clear, subject to change or discovery
			- Nature of projects has changed as part of shift from physical market to digital market.
		- How does Agile help solve problems
			- Incorporate continuously changing requirements
			- allow for adaptation to stakeholder feedback
				- Too many feedback loops lead to too much information to process, and can cause project collapse
					- Is this a downside of Agile in general, or our particular implementation?
			- Smaller product increments
				- Allow for more feedback
				- [[Me]] Also allows for shorter time to market from features
		- What are the cons/downsides for Agile?
			- Does not fully align with "standard products"
				- Less need iteration means less benefit from Agile
			- Requires a lot of clear communication and good team org structure
		- Depending on scale, or nature of work, may switch between Agile & Waterfall
			- Personally iterate while working on a Waterfall team project, or vice versa
		- Waterfall good for execution speed, but not good at responding
			- [[Agile]] requires someone to think
			- Payment processing, or Customer Service escalations: well defined, good for waterfall
			- No need to reinvent the weel for some processes
		- Agile Values
			- From [[Agile Manifesto]]
			- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools?
			- **Working software (/product)** over comprehensive documentation?
			- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation?
			- **Responding to change** over following a plan?
			- Team generally thinks we're doing well on most of these, but to a fualt sometimes
				- Too acommodating to stakeholder feedback
		- Team structure
			- Flagged by several people as not being optimal
		- Zombie Projects
			- please flag if you know of them
		- Pulled from the Chat
			- "Do you think agile makes it harder to estimate time-till-completion?"
				- [[Me]] Agile encourages a different mindset, changing from "time to done" to "time to happy"
					- "Time to done" can still be estimated (sprint planning), but "time to happy" depends on feedback cycles
